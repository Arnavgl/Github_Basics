1. Do git init in that folder where you will add files, basically push your files
2. Link your local machine folder with some remote repository by using the "git remote add origin <https link>" command
3. Do "git status" to check for files to be committed
4. Push your code from local to remote (2 Steps)
    a. add: telling the github what all I'm going to add "git add <filename> / ."
    b. commit: give message from local to remote machine while committing the file
5. git config --global user.name <your username>
6. git config --global user.email <your email>

I. "git diff": diff of what is changed but not staged
II. "git diff --staged": diff of what is staged but not yet commited
